# Active Session - RentHunt

**Session Start**: 2025-10-06 ~08:00 UTC+3  
**Current Time**: 2025-10-06 13:05 UTC+3  
**Session Duration**: ~5 hours  
**Current Mode**: EXPLORE (completing persistent_context before PLAN transition)

---

## Current Focus

**Primary Task**: Building complete persistent_context structure with verbose documentation

**Status**: 90% complete
- ✅ Directory structure created
- ✅ 5/7 foundation files created
- ⏳ Creating: progress_tracker.md, active_session.md (this file)
- ⏳ Pending: workflow_state files, reasoning files, checkpoint

**Next Immediate Action**: Complete remaining persistent_context files, then await user approval to enter PLAN mode

---

## Session Context

### What We're Building
**Product**: RentHunt - A preference-driven long-term apartment rental platform with native roommate compatibility matching

**MVP Goal**: Validate swipe-based apartment discovery with roommate compatibility scoring (no backend, mobile-only prototype)

**Current Phase Objective**: Complete EXPLORE phase by documenting all architectural decisions and context before entering detailed PLAN phase

---

## Recent Work Summary (This Session)

### 1. Initial Exploration (08:00 - 10:00)
**Accomplished**:
- Technology stack research (React ecosystem, UI frameworks, swipe libraries)
- Identified hover.dev as source for swipe card implementation
- Selected vite-react-boilerplate as starter template
- Chose shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS for UI components
- Confirmed Zustand for state management

**Key Decisions**:
- Vite over Next.js (frontend-first approach)
- shadcn/ui over component libraries (copy-paste, no lock-in)
- hover.dev code over custom swipe implementation (saves 4-8 days)

---

### 2. User Journey & Screen Mapping (10:00 - 11:00)
**Accomplished**:
- Mapped complete user flow from onboarding through feedback
- Identified 16 screens (9 onboarding + 7 main app)
- Defined P0 features: onboarding, swipe, shortlist, detail, scheduler, feedback
- Deferred: virtual tours, messaging, proactive roommate matching

**Approval Gates Passed**:
- Q1-Q10 answered by user (technology stack, scope, design fidelity, etc.)
- Mobile-first confirmed, functional MVP over high polish
- Viewing scheduler and feedback form confirmed as P0

---

### 3. Roommate Feature Deep Dive (11:00 - 12:00)
**Accomplished**:
- Explored 3 models via 27-step sequential thinking session:
  - Model A: Proactive people-matching (like dating app) - REJECTED
  - Model B: Property-first with compatibility scoring - SELECTED
  - Model C: Simplified existing groups only - REJECTED
- Designed compatibility algorithm (weighted dimensions)
- Defined roommate preference dimensions (cleanliness, social level, noise, schedule, smoking, pets, drinking)
- Clarified supply model (new listings only, no mid-lease replacements)

**Critical Decisions**:
- Model B selected: Users swipe on apartments, compatibility scores shown for roommates
- Stranger matching is must-have MVP feature (core differentiator)
- Max group size: 3 people
- Equal budget splits only
- No user-to-user messaging in MVP

---

### 4. Data Schema & Architecture (12:00 - 12:30)
**Accomplished**:
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- Designed domain model with bounded contexts (Discovery, Evaluation, Transaction)
- Planned Zustand store architecture (5 stores: userPreferences, apartments, shortlist, viewings, feedback)
- Specified mock data structure (10 apartments: 3 solo, 4 group, 3 room-available)
- Created roommate persona specifications (Alex, Jordan, Sam, Casey, Taylor)

---

### 5. Final Exploration Recap (12:30 - 13:00)
**Accomplished**:
- Delivered comprehensive recap of all exploration findings
- Answered final approval gate questions (Q1-Q6 on roommate model details)
- User confirmed Model B approach with refinements:
  - Budget pre-filtered (roommate compatibility evaluated after price fit)
  - Dual preference onboarding (apartment + roommate)
  - Compatibility score displayed on cards for room-available apartments
- Confirmed ready to build persistent_context before PLAN mode

---

### 6. Persistent Context Creation (13:00 - Current)
**Accomplished**:
- Created directory structure
- Wrote comprehensive foundation files:
  - product_intent.md (vision, problem statement, success criteria)
  - system_architecture.md (patterns, component hierarchy, state management)
  - technical_environment.md (stack, tools, dependencies, constraints)
  - domain_model.md (entities, aggregates, bounded contexts, ubiquitous language)
  - constraints.md (platform, feature, data, temporal, UX constraints)
  - progress_tracker.md (phase status, completed work, risks, metrics)
  - active_session.md (this file - session context)

**In Progress**:
- Workflow state files (current_mode.md, mode_transitions.md)
- Reasoning files (decision_log.md, open_questions.md)
- Verbose checkpoint (checkpoint_20251006_1305.md)

---

## Open Threads

### Resolved
- ✅ Roommate matching model (Model B confirmed)
- ✅ Virtual tour format (deferred to post-MVP)
- ✅ Navigation model (mobile bottom tabs)
- ✅ Max group size (3 people)
- ✅ Budget split handling (equal only)
- ✅ Location input method (city → neighborhoods)
- ✅ Onboarding flow control (mandatory)
- ✅ Viewing scheduler constraints (no Sat, no Fri PM)

### Pending (for PLAN Phase)
- ⏳ Exact compatibility scoring weights (need to define in algorithm)
- ⏳ Mock data generation strategy (manual vs scripted - likely hybrid)
- ⏳ Roommate profile photo approach (stock photos vs illustrations)
- ⏳ Component customization level for shadcn/ui

---

## Context Window Status

**Information Loaded**:
- Shadow Crew Constitution (CREW.md)
- Architect role guidelines
- All exploration findings
- Complete decision history
- Sequential thinking sessions (51 thoughts across 2 sessions)
- User approval gate responses

**Key Context Preserved**:
- Roommate feature complexity analysis
- Model A vs B vs C trade-offs
- Compatibility algorithm design
- Data schema specifications
- 16-screen inventory with requirements

**Risk of Context Loss**:
- LOW - All critical context now captured in persistent_context files
- Future sessions can load from persistent_context instead of relying on conversation history

## Upcoming Work

### Immediate (Next 15 minutes)
1. Complete active_session.md (this file)
2. Create workflow_state/current_mode.md
3. Create workflow_state/mode_transitions.md
4. Create reasoning/decision_log.md
5. Create reasoning/open_questions.md
6. Create checkpoints/checkpoint_20251006_1305.md (VERBOSE - comprehensive session snapshot)

### After Persistent Context Complete
1. Present completion to user
2. Await approval to transition to PLAN mode
3. Begin PLAN phase deliverables:
   - Component hierarchy design
   - Detailed file structure
   - Zustand store implementation plan
   - Mock data generation
   - hover.dev integration strategy
   - Implementation roadmap

## Collaboration Notes

### User Preferences (Observed)
- Values depth over speed (requested verbose checkpoint)
- Prefers architectural thinking before implementation
- Wants full context preservation for future sessions
- Appreciates Shadow Crew compliance (CREW.md principles)
- Follows @/architect and @/engineer workflow patterns

### Communication Style
- Direct, technical communication (no fluff)
- Approval gate pattern for major decisions
- Iterative refinement (explores deeply before locking)
- Uses tools: sequential thinking, web search for research

### Decision-Making Pattern
- Asks clarifying questions before committing
- Weighs trade-offs explicitly (complexity vs value)
- Prefers pragmatic MVP scope (defer advanced features)
- Values transparency in architectural choices

## Session Health

**Energy Level**: High (no fatigue, clear direction)  
**Clarity**: Excellent (all architectural decisions made)  
**Blockers**: None  
**Momentum**: Strong (approaching PLAN phase with complete context)

**Quality of Output**: High

- Decisions grounded in analysis
- Trade-offs documented
- Future evolution paths identified

---

## Session Continuity Plan

**If Session Ends Before Completion**:
1. Current progress: 90% of persistent_context complete
2. Remaining work: workflow_state files, reasoning files, checkpoint
3. Resume point: Continue file creation from where left off
4. Context preserved: All foundation files contain complete context

**If Session Continues**:
1. Complete remaining persistent_context files (15 minutes)
2. Present to user for review
3. Await PLAN mode approval
4. Begin component hierarchy design

**For Future Sessions**:
1. Read persistent_context/foundation/* files to load context
2. Check progress_tracker.md for current phase
3. Review decision_log.md for architectural choices
4. Check open_questions.md for pending items
5. Resume work from last checkpoint

**Active session is productive and on track. Persistent context creation nearly complete.**
