## Current Focus

**Current Phase**: UI Development ✅ COMPLETE

**What Was Built**:
1. ✅ **Onboarding Flow**: 6 comprehensive screens with validation and progress tracking
2. ✅ **Swipe Interface**: Tinder-style cards with animations and mock apartment data
3. ✅ **Shortlist Screen**: Saved apartments with sort/filter functionality
4. ✅ **Viewings Screen**: Schedule management with today/upcoming sections
5. ✅ **Profile Screen**: Preferences display with edit capability
6. ✅ **Mobile App Shell**: Bottom navigation with route protection
7. ✅ **Type Safety**: All TypeScript errors resolved, build successful

**Next Phase Options**:
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real APIs (authentication, apartment data, scheduling)
2. **Advanced Features**: Implement swipe gestures library (React Spring), real compatibility scoring
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests (Vitest), E2E tests (Playwright), accessibility testing
4. **Polish**: Add loading states, error handling, skeleton screens, toast notifications
5. **Deployment**: Set up Vercel/Netlify deployment, environment configuration

**Recommended Next**: Backend Integration - UI is complete and ready for real data sources
