## Current Focus

**Next Phase**: UI Development - Ready to build the actual RentHunt mobile interface

**Available Options**:
1. **Continue with UI Development**: Build mobile swipe interface, onboarding flow, apartment cards
2. **Add Component Library**: Implement more shadcn/ui components for the interface
3. **Create Mock Data**: Generate realistic apartment and roommate data
4. **Setup Navigation**: Implement React Router or similar for screen flow

**Recommended Next**: UI Development - The state management foundation is complete and ready for the user interface.
- ✅ Design component hierarchy (completed)
- ✅ Plan file structure (completed)
- ✅ Architect Zustand stores (completed)
- ✅ Create mock data specification (completed)
- ✅ Plan hover.dev integration (completed)
- ✅ Build implementation roadmap (completed)

**Next Immediate Action**: Present PLAN completion to user, await approval to transition to IMPLEMENT mode

## Session Context

### What We're Building
**Product**: RentHunt - A preference-driven long-term apartment rental platform with native roommate compatibility matching

**MVP Goal**: Validate swipe-based apartment discovery with roommate compatibility scoring (no backend, mobile-only prototype)

**Current Phase Objective**: PLAN phase complete - all technical specifications documented and ready for implementation

- 13 persistent context files created (4,361+ lines)
- Ready for PLAN phase transition

**Key Context Preserved**:
- Technology stack: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Zustand
- Roommate Model B: Property-first with compatibility scoring
- 16 screens mapped, MVP constraints defined
- Domain model with 5 core entities
- 12 major decisions with rationale

---

### PLAN Phase Start (2025-10-15 11:40 UTC+3)
**Transition Status**: Active → Completed
- ✅ Updated current_mode.md to PLAN
- ✅ Updated active_session.md
- ✅ Executed all 6 PLAN deliverables

**PLAN Objectives Achieved**:
1. ✅ Design component hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages)
2. ✅ Plan detailed file structure (src/ directory layout, naming conventions)
3. ✅ Architect Zustand stores (5 stores with full API)
4. ✅ Create mock data specification (JSON schemas, generation approach)
5. ✅ Plan hover.dev integration (code extraction, TypeScript conversion)
6. ✅ Build implementation roadmap (dependency-ordered tasks, time estimates)

---

### PLAN Deliverables Created

#### 1. Component Hierarchy Design (`plan/component_hierarchy.md`)
- 51 components across 5 levels (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
- Screen-to-component mapping for all 16 screens
- Reusability analysis and implementation patterns

#### 2. File Structure Specification (`plan/file_structure.md`)
- Complete src/ directory layout with 12 top-level directories
- Naming conventions and import patterns
- TypeScript path mapping configuration

#### 3. Zustand Stores Architecture (`plan/zustand_stores.md`)
- 5 stores: userPreferences, apartments, shortlist, viewings, feedback
- Full API specification (state, actions, selectors, persistence)
- Cross-store communication patterns

#### 4. Mock Data Specification (`plan/mock_data_spec.md`)
- 10 apartments (3 solo, 4 group, 3 room-available) + 5 roommate personas
- JSON schemas and generation utilities
- Compatibility scoring test data

#### 5. hover.dev Integration Plan (`plan/hover_dev_integration.md`)
- 3-phase integration strategy (extraction → TypeScript → domain adaptation)
- Store integration and performance optimization
- Risk mitigation and testing approach

#### 6. Implementation Roadmap (`plan/implementation_roadmap.md`)
- 8-week timeline with 40 detailed tasks
- Dependency-ordered execution with critical path
- Risk management and success metrics

## Open Threads

### Resolved (from EXPLORE)
- ✅ Roommate matching model (Model B confirmed)
- ✅ Technology stack (Vite + React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Zustand)
- ✅ MVP scope (mobile-only, max 3 people, equal splits)
- ✅ 16 screens mapped with requirements
- ✅ Compatibility algorithm designed
- ✅ Domain entities defined

### Pending (for IMPLEMENT Phase)
- ⏳ Execute implementation roadmap (32-40 days)
- ⏳ Set up development environment
- ⏳ Create apartment card components
- ⏳ Integrate swipe functionality
- ⏳ Implement onboarding flow

---

## Context Window Status

**Information Loaded**:
- Shadow Crew Constitution compliance
- Checkpoint resume from 2025-10-06 13:34
- Complete EXPLORE phase context
- All persistent context files available

**Key Context Preserved**:
- Roommate feature complexity analysis
- Model B architectural decision
- Technology stack rationale
- MVP scope boundaries
- 16-screen user journey
- Component architecture and file structure
- Implementation timeline and dependencies

**Risk of Context Loss**:
- LOW - All context preserved in persistent_context files
- Checkpoint system enables clean resumes

## Upcoming Work

### Immediate (Next Action)
1. Present PLAN completion summary to user
2. Await user approval to transition to IMPLEMENT
3. Begin IMPLEMENT phase with infrastructure setup

### IMPLEMENT Phase Preview (8 weeks)
1. **Week 1-2**: Infrastructure & Onboarding
2. **Week 3-4**: Discovery & Evaluation Core
3. **Week 5-6**: Advanced Features
4. **Week 7-8**: Testing & Launch

### Transition Readiness
- ✅ All PLAN deliverables complete
- ✅ Technical specifications comprehensive

- Wants full context preservation for session continuity
- Appreciates Shadow Crew compliance and transparency
- Uses checkpoint resume for session management

### Communication Style
- Direct, technical communication
- Approval gate pattern for major decisions
- Iterative refinement approach
- Values transparency in architectural choices

### Decision-Making Pattern
- Pragmatic MVP focus (defer advanced features)
- Trade-off analysis (complexity vs value)
- User authority respected at all times

2. Awaiting IMPLEMENT transition approval
3. Ready for code implementation

**For IMPLEMENT Phase**:
1. Follow implementation_roadmap.md for task execution
2. Use todo_list for daily task tracking
3. Create checkpoints at weekly milestones
4. Maintain persistent_context updates

**Future Sessions**:
1. Read persistent_context/plan/ files for technical specifications
2. Check current_mode.md for active phase
3. Resume from implementation_roadmap.md
4. Use component_hierarchy.md for development guidance
