## IMPLEMENT Phase - Pending

### üî® Future Work (Estimated 32-40 days)

**Setup** (1-2 days):
- Clone boilerplate
- Install dependencies
- Configure TailwindCSS theme
- Set up project structure

**Onboarding Flow** (7-9 days):
- Welcome ‚Üí Living situation ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Budget ‚Üí Space requirements
- Apartment preferences ‚Üí Timeline ‚Üí Roommate preferences (complex) ‚Üí Review

**Discovery** (6-8 days):
- Swipe interface integration
- Apartment card component
- Compatibility badge
- Shortlist management

**Evaluation** (10-12 days):
- Apartment detail page with roommate profiles
- Viewing scheduler (calendar UI - complex)
- Feedback form

**Infrastructure** (3-4 days):
- Zustand stores setup
- Mock data creation
- Navigation routing

**Testing & Polish** (4-6 days):
- Manual testing on devices
- Bug fixes
- UX refinements

**Status**: Blocked on PLAN phase completion

## Risks & Mitigation

### Current Risks

**Risk 1**: Roommate Feature Complexity  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: MITIGATED  
**Mitigation**: Model B approach (property-first) reduces complexity vs people-matching. Equal splits and max 3 people further simplify.

**Risk 2**: Viewing Scheduler Calendar UI  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: MONITORED  
**Mitigation**: Use shadcn/ui calendar component as base. Same-day priority simplifies logic (just need today vs future days).

**Risk 3**: Mock Data Quality  
**Severity**: Low  
**Status**: ACCEPTED  
**Mitigation**: Hybrid approach (manual roommate personas, scripted apartment variations). 10 apartments sufficient for MVP validation.

**Risk 4**: Swipe Gesture Performance on Low-End Devices  
**Severity**: Low  
**Status**: MONITORED  
**Mitigation**: hover.dev code uses hardware-accelerated Framer Motion. Fallback: reduce animation complexity if needed.

### No Current Blockers
- All approval gates passed
- All architectural decisions made
- All dependencies identified
- Development environment specified
