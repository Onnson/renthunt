- âœ… shadcn/ui initialized and configured
- âœ… Basic atomic components created (Button, Input, Card, Text, Icon)
- âœ… Build verification successful (TypeScript + Vite production build)
- âœ… Component exports temporarily disabled (will re-enable systematically)

### Sequential Implementation Progress

**Completed Steps:**
1. âœ… Boilerplate analysis - React 19.1.0, Zustand 5.0.6, TypeScript 5.8.3
2. âœ… Config file adaptation - Removed router dependencies, added shadcn/ui deps
3. âœ… TypeScript paths configured - @/ imports working
4. âœ… Directory structure created - All 12 directories with placeholder index.ts files
5. âœ… Basic entry files created - App.tsx shows RentHunt welcome screen
6. âœ… Dependencies installed - npm install successful, cleaned up unnecessary packages
7. âœ… Dev server validation - Vite running successfully on localhost:5173
8. âœ… shadcn/ui setup - Component library initialized and configured
9. âœ… Basic atoms created - Button, Input, Card, Text, Icon components implemented
10. âœ… Build verification - TypeScript compilation and production build successful

**Infrastructure Setup: COMPLETE âœ…**

## IMPLEMENT Phase Status Update

### âœ… COMPLETED: Infrastructure Setup
**Status**: All infrastructure components successfully implemented and validated
**Duration**: ~45 minutes from PLAN approval to working development environment
**Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, production build working, dev server operational

### ðŸš€ READY TO START: State Management Implementation
**Next Phase**: Zustand stores and mock data integration
**Approach**: Follow zustand_stores.md specifications exactly
**Timeline**: Implement 5 stores with full API as specified

### Shadow Crew Standards Applied
- **Chain of Thought**: Methodical step-by-step infrastructure implementation
- **Re-reading**: Constant reference to PLAN specifications during implementation
- **Progress Validation**: Each component tested and validated before proceeding
- **Radical Transparency**: All technical decisions and issues clearly documented
- **Omission Tagging**: Missing details explicitly marked for future implementation

## Memory Graph Tracking Initialized

### Entities Created
- **Project**: RentHunt MVP (main project entity)
- **Phase**: IMPLEMENT (current active phase)
- **Task**: Infrastructure Setup (current active task)
- **Methodology**: Sequential Thinking (approach entity)
- **Standards**: Shadow Crew (compliance entity)

### Relationships Established
- Project â†’ Phase: IMPLEMENT (current_phase)
- Phase â†’ Task: Infrastructure Setup (current_task)
- Task â†’ Methodology: Sequential Thinking (approach_used)
- Project â†’ Standards: Shadow Crew (compliance_required)

## Sequential Thinking Session Plan

### Session 1: Infrastructure Setup Analysis
**Objective**: Break down infrastructure setup into methodical steps

**Sequential Thinking Parameters**:
- Total estimated steps: 8-12 (to be determined through analysis)
- Current step: 1 (initial analysis)
- Branching allowed: Yes (for technical alternatives)
- Revision capability: Yes (based on findings)

**Key Analysis Areas**:
1. Project initialization requirements
2. Dependency management strategy
3. TypeScript configuration needs
4. File structure implementation
5. Development environment validation

### Expected Outputs from Session
- Detailed step-by-step infrastructure setup plan
- Technical decision points with alternatives
- Risk assessment for each step
- Success validation criteria

---

## Current Implementation Focus

### Immediate Next Steps (Post-Sequential Thinking)
1. **Sequential Thinking Session**: Analyze infrastructure setup requirements
2. **Memory Graph Updates**: Track analysis findings and decisions
3. **Project Initialization**: Begin actual code setup based on analysis
4. **Validation**: Test each infrastructure component thoroughly

### Technical Specifications Available
- âœ… `file_structure.md`: Complete directory layout and conventions
- âœ… `component_hierarchy.md`: Atomic design foundation requirements
- âœ… `zustand_stores.md`: Store architecture and persistence setup
- âœ… `mock_data_spec.md`: Data generation and loading requirements

### Risk Mitigation
- **Fallback Plans**: Identified for each major component
- **Validation Steps**: Built into each implementation step
- **Reversion Capability**: Clear rollback points defined

---

## Shadow Crew Compliance

### Radical Transparency Applied
- **Current Knowledge**: All PLAN specifications available, no implementation experience with this stack yet
- **Assumptions Made**: Standard Vite + React setup patterns will apply
- **Limitations Identified**: No direct experience with RicardoValdovinos/vite-react-boilerplate
- **Uncertainties**: Exact dependency versions and potential conflicts

### Omission Tracking
- `# [omitted:implementation_details]` - Specific code examples not yet generated
- `# [omitted:actual_implementation_steps]` - Hands-on setup not yet performed
- `# [omitted:runtime_testing]` - No actual application testing completed yet

## Context Preservation

### What This Checkpoint Captures
- IMPLEMENT phase official start with user approval
- Sequential thinking methodology activation
- Memory graph tracking initialization
- Shadow Crew standards confirmation
- Infrastructure setup planning initiation

### Future Session Continuity
To resume from this checkpoint:
1. Read `current_mode.md` for active IMPLEMENT objectives
2. Check memory graph for current task status
3. Review sequential thinking outputs for infrastructure plan
4. Reference PLAN specifications for technical details
5. Continue with project initialization

---

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Code Quality Commitments
- **TypeScript Strict**: No any types, full type coverage
- **ESLint Clean**: Zero violations, consistent formatting
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish 60fps target from start
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance built-in

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Store and data flow validation
- **Manual Testing**: UI/UX validation at each step
- **Build Verification**: Clean compilation required

**Clarity**: Excellent (comprehensive PLAN specifications available)
**Blockers**: None (all prerequisites met)
**Momentum**: Strong (user approval received, methodology established)

**Quality Assurance**: Shadow Crew standards active and confirmed
