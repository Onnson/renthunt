## Executive Summary

### Mission Accomplished
Built complete architectural foundation for RentHunt MVP - a mobile-only "OKCupid + Airbnb hybrid" for long-term apartment rentals with native roommate compatibility matching.

### Key Outputs
1. ✅ Technology stack finalized (Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Zustand)
2. ✅ Roommate architecture: Model B (property-first with compatibility scoring)
3. ✅ 16 screens mapped (9 onboarding + 7 main app)
4. ✅ Domain model with 5 core entities + bounded contexts
5. ✅ 12 major architectural decisions documented with rationale
6. ✅ MVP scope locked (mobile-only, max 3 people, equal splits, no virtual tours)
7. ✅ Persistent context: 12 comprehensive files (4,100+ lines)

### Critical Decisions
- **Roommate Model**: Property-first with compatibility scoring (not people-matching)
- **Stranger Matching**: Must-have for MVP (core differentiator)
- **Platform**: Mobile-only (no desktop responsive)
- **Constraints**: Max 3 people, equal splits, no Sat/Fri PM viewings
- **Deferred**: Virtual tours, user messaging, proactive people-matching

## Technology Stack (Locked)

```
Frontend: Vite 5.x + React 19 + TypeScript 5.x
Styling: TailwindCSS 3.x + shadcn/ui (copy-paste components)
Animation: Framer Motion 11.x (swipe gestures)
State: Zustand 4.x (5 stores planned)
Icons: Lucide React
Dates: date-fns 3.x
Boilerplate: RicardoValdovinos/vite-react-boilerplate
Swipe Source: hover.dev Swipe Cards (FREE)
```

**Rationale**: Fast prototyping, full ownership, modern stack, proven patterns.

---

## Roommate Architecture (Model B)

### The Decision
After 27-thought sequential analysis, selected **Model B: Property-First with Compatibility Scoring**

### How It Works
1. User completes dual preferences (apartment + roommate)
2. Platform filters apartments by apartment criteria (budget, location, size)
3. User swipes on APARTMENTS (not people)
4. Room-available apartments show compatibility scores for existing roommates
5. User decides: apartment + roommates as package deal

### Why Model B
- Aligns with "OKCupid algorithm + Airbnb browsing" vision
- Budget pre-filtered (user confirmed: "budget already considered before roommate evaluation")
- Simpler than Model A people-matching (+5-8 days vs +15-20 days)
- Maintains core differentiator (compatibility scoring)
- Single swipe interface (better UX than two-phase)

### Compatibility Algorithm
```typescript
Weighted dimensions (0-100 score):
- Cleanliness: 20%
- Social level: 15%
- Noise level: 15%
- Work schedule: 10%
- Smoking: 15% (hard constraint)
- Pets: 15%
- Drinking: 10%
```

## 16 Screens Mapped

### Onboarding (9 screens)
1. Welcome
2. Living situation choice (solo/group/seeking roommates)
3. Location (city → neighborhoods)
4. Budget & size
5. Space requirements
6. Apartment preferences (amenities)
7. Timeline (move-in date, lease duration)
8. **Roommate preferences** (conditional - only for seekers)
9. Review & complete

### Main App (7 screens)
10. Swipe interface (with compatibility badges)
11. Shortlist view
12. Apartment detail (with roommate profiles section)
13. Viewing scheduler (calendar, same-day priority)
14. Post-viewing feedback (dual: personal + fairness)
15. Profile/settings
16. Navigation shell (bottom tabs)

---

## Domain Model (Core Entities)

### Apartment (Aggregate Root)
- Type: 'whole' | 'room-available'
- For room-available: availableRooms, totalRooms, currentRoommates[]
- Business rule: If room-available, must have currentRoommates

### RoommateProfile (Value Object)
- Demographics: name, age, gender, occupation
- Preferences: cleanliness, social, noise, schedule, smoking, pets, drinking
- Photo (stock image for MVP)

### User (Aggregate Root)
- Dual preferences: apartment + roommate (if seeking)
- Search context: seekingRoommates, hasGroup, groupSize (1-3)
- Activity: shortlist, viewings, feedback

### Viewing (Entity)
- Scheduled physical apartment tour
- Business hours: Mon-Thu 10AM-7PM, Fri 10AM-5PM, Sat CLOSED, Sun 11AM-5PM
- Constraints: Max 3/day, 1-hour blocks, 2-hour lead time

### Feedback (Value Object)
- Dual sections: Personal (user-scoped) + Fairness (global)
- Required after viewing (no skip)

---

## Zustand Stores (5 Planned)

1. **userPreferencesStore** - Apartment + roommate preferences, onboarding state
2. **apartmentsStore** - Inventory, filtering, current swipe index, compatibility scores
3. **shortlistStore** - Saved apartment IDs
4. **viewingsStore** - Scheduled viewings, available slots, same-day optimization
5. **feedbackStore** - Submitted feedback, pending reviews

All with LocalStorage persistence via Zustand persist middleware.

## Implementation Estimates

### By Phase
- **PLAN**: 4-6 hours (component hierarchy, file structure, stores, roadmap)
- **IMPLEMENT**: 32-40 days (6-8 weeks full-time)

### By Component
- Onboarding: 7-9 days
- Discovery (swipe): 6-8 days
- Evaluation (detail, scheduler, feedback): 10-12 days
- Infrastructure (stores, mock data, routing): 3-4 days
- Testing & polish: 4-6 days

**Critical path**: Roommate preference onboarding → Compatibility algorithm → Roommate profile display

---

## Open Questions (3 Pending for PLAN)

1. **Exact compatibility scoring weights** - Use draft (20%, 15%, 15%, 10%, 15%, 15%, 10%) or refine?
2. **Mock data generation** - Manual, scripted, or hybrid approach?
3. **Roommate profile photos** - Stock photos (Unsplash), illustrations, or text-only?

All non-blocking. Can proceed with reasonable defaults.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Roommate Feature Complexity
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: MITIGATED (Model B approach, max 3 people, equal splits)

### Risk 2: Viewing Scheduler Calendar UI
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Status**: MONITORED (use shadcn/ui calendar component, same-day priority simplifies)

### Risk 3: Mock Data Quality
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: ACCEPTED (hybrid approach, 10 apartments sufficient)

### Risk 4: Swipe Performance
- **Severity**: Low
- **Status**: MONITORED (hover.dev uses hardware-accelerated Framer Motion)

**No current blockers.**
