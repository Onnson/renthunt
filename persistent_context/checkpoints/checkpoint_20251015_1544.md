## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Scope (MVP)
- Button-based swipe (not touch gestures yet)
- Mock data only (3 apartments)
- No backend integration
- No authentication
- No real image uploads
- No map integration
- Basic error handling

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Set up authentication (Auth0/Clerk)
   - Create apartment data API
   - Implement viewing scheduling backend
   - Add real-time updates

2. **Advanced Swipe**:
   - Integrate React Spring for touch gestures
   - Add card stack with drag physics
   - Implement undo functionality

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Image galleries with lightbox
   - Map integration for neighborhoods
   - Real compatibility algorithm
   - Push notifications for viewings

4. **Testing & Quality**:
   - Vitest unit tests for stores
   - Playwright E2E tests for flows
   - Accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1)
   - Performance optimization

## Decisions Made This Session

### Decision 1: Button-Based Swipe vs Touch Gestures
**Choice**: Button-based interface  
**Rationale**: Faster to implement, more accessible, avoids gesture library complexity for MVP  
**Impact**: Can upgrade to React Spring gestures later without major refactor

### Decision 2: Mock Data in Components vs Separate File
**Choice**: Inline mock data in HomeScreen  
**Rationale**: Simpler for MVP, easy to locate and modify  
**Impact**: 3 realistic apartments sufficient for validation

### Decision 3: Complete All Screens vs Iterative
**Choice**: Build all main screens in one session  
**Rationale**: Comprehensive delivery shows full user journey  
**Impact**: 4-hour focused session vs multi-day incremental

### Decision 4: Placeholder vs Real Actions
**Choice**: Real state management for all actions  
**Rationale**: Demonstrates true functionality, not just visual mockup  
**Impact**: App is truly functional, ready for backend

---

## Risk Assessment

### Resolved Risks
- ✅ **UI Complexity**: Managed through atomic design and component reuse
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Achieved with strict TypeScript and proper interfaces
- ✅ **State Management**: Zustand stores working perfectly with persistence
- ✅ **Build Issues**: All TypeScript errors resolved, production build successful

### Current Risks
- **Performance on Low-End Devices**: Not tested yet (LOW severity)
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Basic ARIA only (MEDIUM severity)
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Only tested in Chrome (LOW severity)

### Mitigation Plans
- Test on real devices with performance monitoring
- Conduct accessibility audit with screen reader
- Add cross-browser testing to QA checklist
