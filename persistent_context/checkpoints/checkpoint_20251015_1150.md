## Technical Specifications Summary

### Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **State**: Zustand with LocalStorage persistence (5 stores)
- **Components**: Atomic design (atoms â†’ molecules â†’ organisms â†’ templates â†’ pages)
- **Data**: Mock-driven with realistic apartment/roommate profiles
- **Gestures**: hover.dev swipe component adapted for apartment discovery

### Component Breakdown
| Level | Count | Purpose | Reusability |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Atoms | 12 | Basic UI elements | 100% |
| Molecules | 15 | Simple combinations | 80% |
| Organisms | 18 | Complex sections | 60% |
| Templates | 6 | Page layouts | 40% |
| Pages | 16 | Screen implementations | 0% |

### Store Architecture
| Store | Purpose | Persistence | Key Features |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| userPreferences | Onboarding + settings | Yes | Dual preferences, validation |
| apartments | Inventory + swipe state | Yes | Filtering, compatibility, gestures |
| shortlist | Saved apartments | Yes | Notes, organization |
| viewings | Scheduled tours | Yes | Calendar, availability, business hours |
| feedback | Post-viewing reviews | Yes | Dual ratings, statistics |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Infrastructure setup (project init, stores, mock data)
- **Week 2**: Onboarding flow (9 screens with routing)
- **Week 3**: Swipe core (hover.dev integration, apartment cards)
- **Week 4**: Discovery features (shortlist, detail view)
- **Week 5-6**: Advanced features (scheduler, feedback, integration)
- **Week 7-8**: Testing, polish, deployment prep
