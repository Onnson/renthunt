## Technical Implementation Plan

### Component Architecture
```
src/components/
├── layout/           # App shell, navigation, containers
├── onboarding/       # Multi-step onboarding flow
├── swipe/           # Card stack, gestures, animations
├── apartment/       # Detail views, image galleries
├── forms/           # Reusable form components
├── ui/              # shadcn/ui overrides and custom components
└── shared/          # Common utilities and hooks
```

### Screen Flow
```
Onboarding Flow:
Welcome → Living Situation → Location → Budget → Timeline → Roommates → Complete

Main App Flow:
Splash → Onboarding Check → Home (Swipe) → Details → Schedule → Feedback

Navigation:
Bottom tabs: Home, Shortlist, Viewings, Profile
```

### Animation & Interaction Strategy
- **Framer Motion** for complex animations and transitions
- **React Spring** for gesture-based animations
- **CSS Transforms** for performance-critical card movements
- **60fps target** for all swipe interactions

### Mobile-First Design
- **Viewport**: 375px (iPhone) to 428px (iPhone Pro Max)
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px for accessibility
- **Gestures**: Swipe, tap, long press, pull-to-refresh
- **Performance**: GPU acceleration for smooth animations
