# Current Mode - EXPLORE

**Mode**: EXPLORE  
**Entry Time**: 2025-10-06 08:00 UTC+3  
**Current Time**: 2025-10-06 13:10 UTC+3  
**Duration in Mode**: ~5 hours  
**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready to transition to PLAN

---

## Mode Definition

**EXPLORE Mode Purpose**: Research, discover, and validate architectural approaches before committing to detailed planning. Ask questions, evaluate alternatives, and establish foundational context.

---

## EXPLORE Mode Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. ✅ Research and validate technology stack choices
2. ✅ Map complete user journey and identify all screens
3. ✅ Explore roommate feature complexity and select architectural model
4. ✅ Define data schemas and domain model
5. ✅ Establish MVP scope boundaries and constraints
6. ✅ Document all decisions with rationale

### Success Criteria
- [x] All technology choices have documented rationale
- [x] User journey is complete with no gaps
- [x] Roommate feature architecture is decided (Model A/B/C)
- [x] Data schemas support all identified features
- [x] MVP scope is clearly bounded (P0 vs deferred)
- [x] No open architectural questions blocking PLAN phase

## Work Completed in EXPLORE Mode

### Research & Discovery
- ✅ UI framework research (shadcn/ui, Material-UI, Ant Design comparison)
- ✅ Swipe library research (react-tinder-card, custom build, hover.dev)
- ✅ Boilerplate research (vite-react templates)
- ✅ State management research (Zustand, Redux Toolkit, Jotai, Context)

### Architectural Exploration
- ✅ Roommate matching models (27-thought sequential analysis)
  - Model A: Proactive people-matching
  - Model B: Property-first with compatibility scoring ← SELECTED
  - Model C: Simplified existing groups only
- ✅ Compatibility scoring algorithm design
- ✅ Bounded context identification (Discovery, Evaluation, Transaction)
- ✅ Domain entity modeling

### Scope Definition
- ✅ Screen inventory (16 screens identified)
- ✅ Feature prioritization (P0: onboarding through feedback)
- ✅ Constraint documentation (mobile-only, max 3 people, etc.)
- ✅ Deferred features list (virtual tours, messaging, etc.)

### Context Building
- ✅ Product intent documented
- ✅ System architecture designed
- ✅ Technical environment specified
- ✅ Domain model created
- ✅ Constraints cataloged
- ✅ Progress tracking established
- ✅ Active session context captured

## Key Decisions Made in EXPLORE Mode

See `reasoning/decision_log.md` for complete details. Summary:

1. **Technology Stack**: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion + Zustand
2. **Roommate Feature**: Model B (property-first with compatibility scoring)
3. **Swipe Implementation**: hover.dev Swipe Cards (free component)
4. **Platform Target**: Mobile-only MVP
5. **Design Fidelity**: Functional MVP over high polish
6. **Group Size**: Max 3 people
7. **Budget Splits**: Equal only
8. **Stranger Matching**: Must-have for MVP (core differentiator)
9. **Virtual Tours**: Deferred to post-MVP
10. **Viewing Hours**: No Sat, no Fri PM (business constraint)
