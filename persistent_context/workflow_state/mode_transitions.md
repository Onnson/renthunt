## Transition History

### Transition 1: SESSION_START → EXPLORE

**Date**: 2025-10-06 08:00 UTC+3  
**Trigger**: User initiated session with `@/session-init` and "Shadow, RISE!"  
**Initiated By**: User request to begin building "tinder for long-term rental apartments"

**Context at Transition**:
- No prior project context
- Starting from zero (fresh exploration needed)
- User specified: "we're building context right now"
- Focus: Finding UI templates and frameworks for rapid prototyping
- Backend explicitly deferred

**Previous Mode**: N/A (session start)

**Previous Mode Outputs**: None

**New Mode**: EXPLORE

**EXPLORE Mode Objectives**:
1. Research UI frameworks and starter templates for React
2. Identify swipe-based interface libraries
3. Map complete user journey for rental apartment discovery
4. Explore roommate feature complexity and architectural options
5. Define data schemas and domain model
6. Establish MVP scope and constraints
7. Document all architectural decisions

**Exit Criteria for EXPLORE**:
- [x] Technology stack finalized with rationale
- [x] User journey mapped with all screens identified
- [x] Roommate feature architecture decided
- [x] Data schemas defined
- [x] MVP scope clearly bounded
- [x] All approval gates passed by user
- [x] Persistent context structure created
- [ ] User approval to proceed to PLAN mode

**Deliverables from EXPLORE** (will be completed):
- Technology stack decision: Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion + Zustand
- Boilerplate selected: RicardoValdovinos/vite-react-boilerplate
- Swipe implementation: hover.dev Swipe Cards (free component)
- Roommate architecture: Model B (property-first with compatibility scoring)
- Screen inventory: 16 screens (9 onboarding + 7 main app)
- Domain model: Entities, bounded contexts, business rules defined
- Data schemas: TypeScript interfaces for all types
- Mock data spec: 10 apartments, 4-5 roommate personas
- Constraints: Mobile-only, max 3 people, equal splits, etc.
- Persistent context: 13 files created (foundation, workflow_state, reasoning, checkpoints)

**Status**: COMPLETE (awaiting transition approval)

**New Mode**: PLAN

**PLAN Mode Objectives**:
1. Design complete component hierarchy (atomic design structure)
2. Plan detailed file/folder structure for src/
3. Architect Zustand stores with actions, selectors, middleware
4. Create detailed mock data specification
5. Plan hover.dev swipe code integration strategy
6. Build implementation roadmap with dependencies
7. Define component props interfaces
8. Plan state flow patterns
9. Identify reusable components
10. Create task breakdown with time estimates

**Exit Criteria for PLAN**:
- [ ] Component hierarchy complete (all 16 screens covered)
- [ ] File structure defined (folder organization, naming conventions)
- [ ] Zustand stores fully specified (actions, state shape, selectors)
- [ ] Mock data format detailed (JSON structure, generation approach)
- [ ] hover.dev integration plan documented
- [ ] Implementation roadmap created (tasks ordered by dependencies)
- [ ] Component interfaces defined (props, events)
- [ ] Ready to begin IMPLEMENT phase (no architectural unknowns)

**Expected Deliverables from PLAN**:
- Complete component tree (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages)
- src/ directory structure with all files listed
- Zustand store specifications (5 stores with full API)
- Mock data JSON files specification
- hover.dev adaptation strategy
- Implementation task list (ordered, estimated)
- Component prop interfaces
- State management patterns documentation

**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 hours (detailed planning work)

**Status**: PENDING USER APPROVAL

### Transition 3: PLAN → IMPLEMENT

**Date**: 2025-10-15 11:50 UTC+3  
**Trigger**: All PLAN deliverables completed, user issued "Continue" command  
**Initiated By**: Natural progression after PLAN phase completion

**Context at Transition**:
- PLAN phase deliverables all completed in ~10 minutes
- Comprehensive technical specifications ready
- Implementation roadmap detailed with dependency-ordered tasks
- All architectural unknowns resolved
- User approval received via "Continue" command

**Previous Mode**: PLAN

**Previous Mode Outputs**:
- ✅ Component hierarchy designed (51 components, atomic design)
- ✅ File structure specification complete (12 directories, naming conventions)
- ✅ Zustand stores architected (5 stores with full API)
- ✅ Mock data specification (10 apartments, 5 personas, JSON schemas)

## Mode Transition Guidelines

### When to Transition Modes

**EXPLORE → PLAN**:
- All architectural questions answered
- Technology choices finalized
- Domain understanding complete
- Scope clearly bounded
- No unknowns blocking detailed design

**PLAN → IMPLEMENT**:
- Component hierarchy complete
- File structure defined
- All stores architected
- Mock data specified
- Implementation roadmap ready
- No design unknowns remaining

**IMPLEMENT → TEST** (future):
- All screens implemented
- Core flows functional
- Mock data integrated
- Ready for validation

**TEST → DEPLOY** (future):
- All tests passing
- No critical bugs
- Performance acceptable
- Ready for user testing

### Transition Checklist

Before transitioning modes, verify:
- [ ] Current mode objectives 100% complete
- [ ] All deliverables produced
- [ ] Exit criteria met
- [ ] No blockers for next mode
- [ ] Documentation updated (progress_tracker.md, decision_log.md)
- [ ] User approval obtained (for major transitions)
- [ ] Checkpoint created capturing mode outputs

### Transition Artifacts

Each transition should produce:
1. Update to this file (mode_transitions.md)
2. Checkpoint file (timestamped snapshot)
3. Update to progress_tracker.md (phase status)
4. Update to current_mode.md (new mode objectives)

## Historical Context Preservation

**Why Mode Transitions Matter**:
- Provides audit trail of project evolution
- Enables understanding of why decisions were made when
- Facilitates onboarding (for collaborators or future sessions)
- Captures context that might be lost in conversation history
- Documents natural progression of work phases

**How to Use This Log**:
- Review when resuming after break (understand where we left off)
- Reference when making related decisions (avoid repeating analysis)
- Share with collaborators (quickly communicate project stage)
- Debug issues (trace back to when architecture was decided)

---

**Next Transition**: IMPLEMENT mode active (target completion in 32-40 days).
